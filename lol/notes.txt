The browser was making repeated attempts to contact New Relic's monitoring servers (bam.nr-data.net)
All these requests failed with ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED
The application ID (90967276) and session IDs were being tracked
There were automated redirects to informit.com with specific parameters
The pattern suggests possible malicious activity:

  1. Multiple rapid requests
  2. Failed network connections
  3. Automated redirects
  4. Presence of tracking IDs
  5. Suspicious URL parameters

The sequence suggests that after visiting rbs2.com, something triggered multiple automated requests and redirects, possibly indicating:

- A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
- A redirect chain exploit
- Attempted data exfiltration
